# CS50 SCHEDULE APP
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/OFWgLIjm3RA
#### Description:
For my last project I created an schedule App using Flutter and Dart. This app can run in both PCS and mobile/Android devices, and i Built it using the Android Studio Environment.
After clickling this  initial button the user can exit the home screen and is presented the Shcedule page. In this page the user can write down their tasks for the week in the corresponding boxes, making it perfect for an fast and simple way to organize the user's daily tasks

The programmed lines of code used in this project are located in the lib folder, with the main file made to adjust the main page, and the agenda_screen for the schedule page. I used the FLutter/Dart because I wanted to create an android app that I could use on my phone to schedule my own routine in an easy and fast way, That's why I used this language -> easy to learn and specific for the android environment
